How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was easy to compare the two files and see where the error was.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If for some reason you need to find a bug, or an error, you can easily
revert back to the old version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

One of the pros is you control the history of the commits.
One downside is you may forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is made for coding version control.  Often in software development multiple
files relate to each other.  A document version control system is made for documents,
which are often independent of each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use git log to see the commit ids, and what has been changed.
You can use git diff to see the code that has been added or deleted between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You can always go to a previous working version if something in your program breaks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to use get for managing my code changes.
