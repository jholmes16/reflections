 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You may want to use a remote repository when you are using more than one computer,
or when there are multiple people working on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to pull changes manually when you are working on a branch, and want to
complete a change and make sure it works before you add it to the rest of a project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of repositories that are copied on GitHub in your file.
Clones are repositories that are copied on you local machine.
Branches are edits that can be made without affecting another piece of code.

Forks should be used when you want to make an edit on GitHub to another individuals
code.
Clones should be used when you want to copy the code to a local machine.
Branches should be used to make edits to code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

The benefit is that you have local copy of the up-to-date code.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I would edit the code and store the changes on a usb drive, or server and give
the usb drive or directory on the server to my collaborators.
It would be harder, because you would have to make sure everything is in order,
and if it breaks it my be hard to find the error.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
